# Forest-covertype-classification
## Problem Statement: MultiClass Classification of forest covertypes
### Implemented all models, compared using crossvalidation and Hyperparameter Tuning were performed on top 2-3 models.
### Ensemble Techniques like Stacking/Voting were implemented to combine models together for better generalisation and outcome prediction.
