## Problem Statement: MultiClass Classification of forest covertypes
### Implemented all Classification Models, compared using Crossvalidation and Hyperparameter Tuning using Grid/Random SearchCv was performed on top 2-3 models.
### Ensemble Techniques like Stacking/Voting were implemented to combine models together for better generalisation and outcome prediction.
